# azavea_code_sample
Hi!
I decided to upload an assignment I enjoyed from my first ML class.  I have always enjoyed assignments where I get to reimplement something by hand, whether it be hash
tables, markov models, linear algrebra processes, or a machine learning pipeline.  So, I decided to share one of those (pipeline.py) with an accompanying homework (classification_webb.ipynb).
  - The notebook file represents the actual homework and modeling
  - The pipeline file is a "by hand" implementation of some sklearn pipeline functions, most notably a variation of gridsearchCV.

I can produce other samples upon request that are not guided by academic work, but cannot host them publicly.

-Enjoy
