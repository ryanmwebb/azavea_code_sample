# job_ml_code_sample
Hi!
I decided to upload two assignments I enjoyed from my first ML class.  The first assignment consisted of implementing various sklearn pipeline functions (pipeline.py) and using those in a downstream classification problem (classification_webb.ipynb), while the second is entirely contained in the trees_forest_ex.ipynb where we predicted internet quality geographically.  This is a solo-authored assignment (no skeleton code, no collaboration)
  - The notebook file represents the actual homework and modeling
  - The pipeline file is a "by hand" implementation of some sklearn pipeline functions, most notably a variation of gridsearchCV.

If you would be interested in seeing more advanced work, please see my work, done in partnership with Matthew Mauer, applying unsupervised methods to remote sensing poverty mapping with nighttime lights [here](https://github.com/ryanmwebb/detecting_poverty).  We attempt to prove that unsupervised methods are competitive with the traditional CNN transfer learning approach
